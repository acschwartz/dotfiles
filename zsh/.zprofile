#  üöÄ  Zsh Profile (.zprofile - Login Shell Config)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# ---------------------- üß† Notes --------------------------------------
# .zprofile     run once at login
# .zshrc        run every time you open a new tab/window

# On macOS, Terminal apps launch your shell as a login shell by default
# which means both .zprofile and .zshrc run.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
## .zprofile (login shell config):
#   Used for setting environment variables that need to be initialized
#   once per login session.
#
#   Examples:
#     - Adding Homebrew and VS Code paths so your system ‚Äúknows‚Äù about
#       those tools during the whole session. (PATH is where the shell
#       looks for executables when you type a command.)
#     - Variables related to locale (LANG), or things that affect the
#       whole user environment at login.
#     - These settings affect all shells and GUI apps launched after login.
#     - Loaded once when you log in,
#       e.g., opening Terminal app, logging in via SSH.

## üç∫ Homebrew (brew)
# Set up Homebrew environment (Apple Silicon installs to /opt/homebrew)
#   - adds Homebrew‚Äôs binary directory to PATH
#   - sets up Homebrew's env vars & makes them available to your shell
#      - e.g. HOMEBREW_PREFIX, HOMEBREW_CELLAR, HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY
# Ensures `brew` and other installed tools are available in the terminal
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

## üëæ VSCode (code)
# Add the Visual Studio Code (code) CLI to the PATH
# This lets you launch VS Code from the terminal using the `code` command
export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin"
